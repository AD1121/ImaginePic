# Gallery Website Build With Bootstrap 4 and Particles.Js Using Gulp

To run live-server is needed. I used the live server in Visual Studio Code but goes well with NPM live-server as well.

<!-- Code Blocks -->
```bash 

  npm install -g live-server

  live-server

```

If you are using Visul Studio Code as a editor you can choose live-server there.
